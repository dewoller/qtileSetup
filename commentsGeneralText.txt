You could be much clearer about what you are actually studying
This is not a criteria
Good stucturing
Missing objectives
Nice summary of benefits
This is good to summarise in a table format
You should not start a sentence with a number
You need some way to designate the difference between paragraphs.  Maybe spacing?
Nice formatting
Good motivation
I like your use of sections and styles
You are a good writer and this in indicative of clear thinking. It was a pleasure to read. 
Each paragraph should be about a SINGLE idea, and each line in that paragraph should relate to that SPECIFIC idea.  I find it useful to, at the start of every paragraph, in heading2 style, put a line that describe EXACTLY what this paragraph is about.  Then go through each line in the paragraph and see if that line relates to the descriptive title, and finally, delete the title, and join together the paragraphs
Good on you for coming up with some type of categorisation
Nice focus
A paragraph should not start with point form
Not supposed to add in new information at the conclusion, the conclusion is for summary only
Your results needed some critical analyis, as it was, your reporting was mostly descriptive. 
Could be fruitfully edited
Would be good if you had an overall framework that the paragraphs fit into
You should not use abbreviations without defining them
Each section should have some text
Inappropriate capitalisation
Incomplete sentence
Sentence does not make sense
