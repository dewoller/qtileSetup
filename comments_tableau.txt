Age better in bins, with bar graph rather than discrete ages
Appropriate use of outer join
average LOS misleading because you do not know the number of admissions that make it up
A wealth of information, densely packed.  Nice!
bins should not be on a line graph, because the values to not transition in a straight line between bins
box and whisker plot needs non-aggregate data to be useful
broken queries
cannot read text that is obscured with color bars
centered text especially inappropriate for point form text
Centered text good for titles but not for reading
circle and pie graphs are poor at showing comparitive size
codes are commonly found within the
Codes need descriptions / labels
color not sufficiently distinct
Color not useful when there are more labels than distinct colors
concise story points
Could have been better organised
could have wider data exploration, eg multiple data sources
"count of distinct admission id" better said as "number of admissions"
Data could use more analysis
decimal points should be rounded consistently
Dollar values should be formatted with a $
duplicate legend colors on same page should be avoided
duplicate legend colors that mean different things, in same story should be avoided
Exceptionally well structured
filter here is redundant, because my eye can do this sort of filtering easily because each item is in its own column
Fine grained colors pretty, but not useful
Good analysis / thinking
Good choice of data sources
good color consistency
Good colorful graph #2, but it could use more interpretation
good combination of count and DRG
good combination of count and LOS on same graph
Good comparision of gender by age
Good data source naming and labelling
Good explanatory text, I learned a lot!
Good introduction
Good introductory overview; 
Good labelling of figures
Good layout
good outline
Good titles
Good use of box and whisker plot for age
good use of calculated fields
Good use of graphics
Good use of grouping
Good use of interactivity to allow option to eliminate overshadowing categories
good use of labels
Good use of multiple axes
Good use of pie chart to illuminate one aspect of bar chart
Good use of proportions
Good use of radio button to choose disease
Good use of size and color
Graphs are so clear I do not notice the absence of explanatory text 
graphs could have better titles / labels / axis labels
graph very interesting
Great age grouping into categories that reflect the course of the disease
Great analysis, you put much thinking into this
Great potential, but you need to zoom in to get really interesting results
Great use of color to show detailed information
has very poor ink to information ratio
highly interactive
I appreciate the attention to detail
I can see you have good thinking but you need to be more precise with expressing it
I dont know if the blank title page added much value.  Might be better to have an introduction here
I liked how you brought in interesting outside facts
I liked how you excluded procedures based on block
I liked the overview but it could use some structure, like the occassional period in the sentence would help
I liked your simple comparisons
I like how you compare the 1 day LOS and 2+day LOS as they are quite different categories
inappropriate use of outer join
Inconsistent coloring
inconsistent labelling, eg percents and absolute values on same page
inconsistent use of diag desc and diag short desc
incorrect use of fields: 
Inefficient data sources
insufficient reuse of data sources, does not well use tableau facilities for data selection, restriction, summarisation
Interesting idea, but I think N is too small to make this graph useful
I really liked how you zoomed into the different complication types 
it is obvisious that you put a lot of thought into this
it looks like a beautiful young mountain range, but what use is it?  I can't even identify the individual data points, because 3/4 have no name even!
It would be good to quantify (and prove) your statement This indicates that G36.- and G37.-
It would be great to look at average DRG / LOS day for the different procedures
legend is missing some values
LOS is a continious variable, so it should not be treated categorically
Major SQL problems
many graphs, but they do not say much
More explanatory text needed to tell the reader what is going on
much duplication within story points
multiple distinct color legends on the same page should be avoided
multiple pie charts should be combined into single bar chart to show comparison
My unconscious bias liked your color scheme
Not useful to have static labels containing numbers, especially when those numbers can already be read from the graph.  Also, numbers in descriptions defeats the purpose of having a graph linked to live data
not useful to include gender when you have nothing interesting to say about it
Numbers are incorrect
numeric values should be right justified
Per population figures should be proportional to population
Per population figures should be proportional to population so it can be a proper comparison
poor data names
poor data source names
Procedure would be better categorised into larger categories
Rich selection of graphs
same admission.
should be able to see all data without scrolling
So many tick boxes not very useful for interactivity
some description is unclear / imprecise, eg
some duplicated story points
Some graphs are redundant
some graphs could have better titles / labels
Some graphs have vastly different scales, so the smaller values cannot show their detail
Some labels truncated
Some of the explanatory text is redundant, ie, it is saying the same thing that can be seen from the graph (waste of ink)
some problems with spacing and layout
some redundant labelling (eg labelling with color what is already labelled with height)
some sheets cannot be shown due to data retrieval errors (inefficent queries?)
some sheets tried a little too hard, maybe better to have less on a sheet, and improve clarity
sometimes the information is more useful when there is LESS of it
spel
Spelling errors
Tableau is for summarising data (mostly), showing individuall patient ages is not so useful
text does not pertain to the data shown
The explanatory text is interesting, but needs to be connected to the actual data on that page
these values should obvisiously not pass the /does this make sense/ test, and shows you did not think well about what you were handing in
The volume of OSAS drowns out the the information in the other types, it should at least be choosable
Titles should be capitalised
titles should not start with numbers
What can you tell me about gender?
when comparing 2 categories, color is useful to distinguish
When comparing 2 categories, they should be side by side to facilitate comparison
would be good to categorise interventions
would have been good to group the procedures
You need a legend when you use colors
you listened to my instructions!
good use of tables
good use of stacked bar graph
Font should be consistent
duplicate distinct colors sets on same page should be avoided
totally unique, you have good thinking around this
